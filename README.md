# Scrabblegame

The game generates a random scrabbled word.
Player will be displayed with a word that has been generated randomly
The user will have to guess the word with the provided character keyboard.

Started working on project from monday.
1. Started by designing the GUI for the game.
2. Implemented little functionalities at a time.
3. The end product should generate a random word from the text file.
4. The genrated word should be scrambled.
5. On user clicks the present characters of the word should be displayed in the label.
6. Once the user has completed the word, a message box will be displayed to show they have won.
7. If the user makes more than 7 wrong guesses, the will lose the game and a message box will be displayed.


Problems faced:
The scrambling of the word - getting the random word to display  as scranmbled was difficult. 
Displaying the generated wprd in the label and saving characters -
On user click the present characters should display on the label above, but when the user clicks on the a different character, the previous previous charcters on label disappears.
Therefore, i had to get the previous character to remain after another button clicks.
