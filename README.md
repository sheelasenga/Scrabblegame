# Scrabblegame

The game generates a random scrabbled word.
Player will be displayed with a word that has been generated randomly
The user will have to guess the word with the provided character keyboard.

Problems faced:
The scrambling of the word - getting the random word to display  as scranmbled was difficult. 
On user click the present characters should display on the label above, but when the user clicks on the a different charcater, the previous previous charcters on label disappears.
Therefore, i had to get the previous character to remain after another button clicks.
